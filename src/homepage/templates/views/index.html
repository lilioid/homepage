        <p>
          This is the personal homepage of me, Lilly Sell, also sometimes called
          <em>ftsell</em>. I'm a computer science student at the University of Hamburg, an activist, a hacker,
          a SysAdmin and sometimes all at once. My expertise and interests are System Administration and
          Automation, Networking (the computer kind) and creating fun applications for whatever seems useful.
          Additionally, I like learning things about privacy, security and how computers work from the ground
          up.

            most commonly used OpenID Connect features but is designed to be as easy to use and understand as
