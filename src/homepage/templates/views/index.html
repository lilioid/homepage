          This is the personal homepage of me, Lilly.
          I'm a professional computer toucher, formerly at the University of Hamburg, now mainly at <i>CCCHH</i> and <i>B1-Systems</i>.
          My expertise and interests are activism, System Administration and Automation, Networking (the computer as well as the people kind) and creating fun applications for whatever seems useful.
          Additionally, I like learning things about privacy, security and how computers work from the ground up.
