        This is the personal homepage of me, Lilly.
        I'm a professional computer toucher, formerly at the University of Hamburg, now mainly at CCCHH and B1-Systems.
        My expertise and interests are activism, System Administration and Automation, Networking (the computer as well
        as the people kind) and creating fun applications for whatever seems useful.
        Additionally, I like learning things about privacy, security and how computers work from the ground up.
